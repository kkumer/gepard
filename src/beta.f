C  NAME
C     BETAF  --  coefficients of beta function of QCD
C  DESCRIPTION
C     The subroutine BETAF for the coefficients  BETA0...BETA3  of the 
C     beta function of QCD up to order alpha_s^5 (N^3LO), normalized by 
C
C          d a_s / d ln mu_r^2  =   BETA0 a_s^2 + BETA1 a_s^3 + ... 
C
C      with  a_s = alpha_s/(4*pi). 
C
C     NB: This normalization is different then Vogt's: BETAx -> -BETAx !!
C
C     The MSbar coefficients are written to the common-block  BETA  for 
C     NFL = 3...6  (parameters NFMIN, NFMAX) quark flavours.
C
C      Beyond NLO the QCD colour factors are hard-wired in this routine,
C      and the numerical coefficients are truncated to six digits.
