This directory holds available experimental data

ep2epgamma/ - data for e p --> e p gamma (also known as DVCS)
gammastarp2gammap/ - data for \gamma^* p --> \gamma p  i.e. true DVCS
gammastarp2Mp/ - data for \gamma^* p --> meson p  i.e. DVMP
DIS/  - data for DIS  

Note:
There should be a unique correspondence between id number of datafile
(specified at its beginning), and the grid of numbers in that
file. Thus, 

1) If you do something to numbers, create new file and new ID !
2) If you just edit information in preamble, you may keep old ID,
   but if you have doubts, create new file with new ID - there 
   are plenty of integers available

This makes it much easier to reproduce old results.

Some informal conventions:

- ids beyond ID=1000 are for mock/fake data 

We should also implements something like this:

- ids beyond ID=500 are for derived data (derived from
  actual data using some contestable theoretical procedure)
