Version 0.9.5 2010-06-25 

	- ADD: Evaluation of gamma function is also controlled by
	       SPEED, saving significant time in fitting
	- ADD: Compiles also with Intel ifort, NAG f95 and GNU gfortran compilers,
	       including OpenMP parallelization.
	- ADD: python extension pygepard.so created
	- ADD: third SO(3) partial wave to 'FIT' model
	       

	{Merged from sid  67:85}
	- ADD: Evolution of GPDs at eta=0 and eta=x
	- ADD: Possibility of eta-dependent ansatz
	- ADD: Mathematica interface completely redone so both
	       calculation of CFFs and fitting is possible from
		   within Mathematica
	- ADD: Evolved Wilson coefficients can be now calculated in
	       the initialization phase which leads to much faster
		   execution
	- FIX: comparison to PEGASUS is OK at NNLO as well
	- FIX: SPEED=3 should be used instead of SPEED=4 now

Version 0.9.3  (2006-12-17)

	- ADD: non-singlet evolution
	- ADD: non-singlet NNLO
	- ADD: MSbar non-diagonal evolution
	- ADD: intelligent choice of y-range for drawing of PDF(x)
	- ADD: many example programs in ex subdirectory which produce
	       data for plots in a big paper
	- ADD: automatic plotting and psfragging of plots
	- FIX: dependence on factorization scale corrected now
	- BUG: SPEED=4 is much more unreliable than before

	{Merged from 0.9-fix2:}
	- FIX: charge-factor bugs (it was not NF-dependent, and was
	       altogher missing from DVCS)
	- ADD: PDF(x), resulting from fit, are also drawn now
	- ADD: Additional experimental data points for fitting

Version 0.9.2  (2006-08-03)

	{Merged from 0.9-fix1:}
	- Fixed F2(P) bug that forced P=1 in DIS case

Version 0.9.1  (2006-07-26)

	- Added possibility of Gaussian integration on 2**ACC points
	  with new parameter ACC=1..6. 
	- Added test routines 'houches' and 'accuracy' for checking 
	  accuracy w.r.t. Les Houches benchmark and w.r.t
	  referent most precise gepard result
	  
Version 0.9  (2006-07-23)

	- Wilson coefficients calculated in initialization phase and
	  together with anomalous dimensions put into common block
	- Integration moved from slatec to 8-point Gaussian
	- Adacf part integrated into source
	- PGPLOT support added
	- Compiles cleanly on both Linux and Cygwin
	- Additional user-friendly documentation in gepard.pdf

Version 0.88  (2006-07-02)

	- Initial version
	- Imported into subversion versioning system
	- Target gepard.exe is broken (so calling from Mathematica
		doesn't work) but "pure Fortran" targets work and produce
		data equivalent with Figs 1 and 2 of Letter

- Version 0.82 (2006-04-06)
	-Numerical integration improved by subdivision of path:
	-LAM..-1/2..1/2..LAM 

- Version 0.8 2006-03-24                                                                                                       

- Version 0.7 2006-03-20
