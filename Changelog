Version 0.9.3  (2006-??-??)

    - ADD: non-singlet evolution subroutines EVOLNSF, ERFUNCNSF, RNNLONSF
    - ADD: MSbar non-diagonal evolution subroutines NDNSF, CB1F
	- ADD: CZERO parameter which can be used to put LO (a_strong^0) term
	       to zero for investigation of NLO effects
	- ADD: inteligent choice of y-range for drawing of PDF(x)

    {Merged from 0.9-fix2:}
    - FIX: charge-factor bugs (not NF-dependent, and altogher
           missing from DVCS)
    - ADD: PDF(x), resulting from fit, are also drawn now

Version 0.9.2  (2006-08-03)

    {Merged from 0.9-fix1:}
	- Fixed F2(P) bug that forced P=1 in DIS case

Version 0.9.1  (2006-07-26)

	- Added possibility of Gaussian integration on 2**ACC points
	  with new parameter ACC=1..6. 
	- Added test routines 'houches' and 'accuracy' for checking 
	  accuracy w.r.t. Les Houches benchmark and w.r.t
	  referent most precise gepard result
	  
Version 0.9  (2006-07-23)

	- Wilson coefficients calculated in intialization phase and
	  together with anomalous dimensions put into common block
	- Integration moved from slatec to 8-point Gaussian
	- Adacf part integrated into source
	- PGPLOT support added
	- Compiles cleanly on both Linux and Cygwin
	- Additional user-friendly documentation in gepard.pdf

Version 0.88  (2006-07-02)

	- Initial version
	- Imported into subversion versioning system
	- Target gepard.exe is broken (so calling from Mathematica
		doesn't work) but "pure Fortran" targets work and produce
		data equivalent with Figs 1 and 2 of Letter

- Version 0.82 (2006-04-06)
	-Numerical integration improved by subdivision of path:
	-LAM..-1/2..1/2..LAM 

- Version 0.8 2006-03-24
