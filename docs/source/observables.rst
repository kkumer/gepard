Processes
---------

Presently, only Deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) process
can be considered fully implemented (using the so-called
BMK formulas). There is also an initial implementation of Deeply virtual
meson production (DVMP) of rho meson, valid for small Bjorken x
kinematics.

Datapoints should have an attribute ``process``, which is one of
the following:

.. _tab-processes:

.. list-table:: Processes
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Proces
     - DataPoint ``process`` value
     - Generic process class
   * - :math:`e p \to e p \gamma`
     - ``ep2epgamma``
     - DVCS
   * - :math:`e n \to e n \gamma`
     - ``en2engamma``
     - DVCS
   * - :math:`\gamma^* p \to \gamma p`
     - ``gammastarp2gammap``
     - DVCS
   * - :math:`\gamma^* p \to \rho^{0} p`
     - ``gammastarp2rho0p``
     - DVMP


Formulas for generic theory class DVMP are implemented as
``g.DVMP``, while those for DVCS have several slightly different
versions:

.. _tab-BMK_formulas:

.. list-table:: Version of BMK formulas
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Theory class
     - description
   * - ``g.BMK``
     - old original BMK formulas from 2005
   * - ``g.hotfixedBMK``
     - improved formulas that are better for JLab kinematics
   * - ``g.BM10ex``
     - best formulas from 2010
   * - ``g.BM10``
     - like ``BM10ex``, but with some Q2-suppresed terms removed
   * - ``g.BM10tw2``
     - like ``BM10`` but with higher twists set to zero

Observables
-----------

Following observables are implemented in gepard. They can be used
as methods of theory objects, or ``yaxis`` attributes of datapoints.

.. list-table:: DVCS observables
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Identifier
     - Description
   * - ``XS``
     - cross-section for leptoproduction of real photon
   * - ``XGAMMA``
     - cross-section for production of real photon by virtual one
   * - ``XUU``
     - beam spin sum a.k.a helicity independent XS
   * - ``XUUw``
     - XUU weighted by BH propagator
   * - ``XLU``
     - beam spin difference a.k.a helicity dependent XS
   * - ``XLUw``
     - XLU weighted by BH propagator
   * - ``XCLU``
     - beam charge-spin difference (COMPASS)
   * - ``XCUU``
     - beam charge-spin sum (COMPASS)
   * - ``AC``
     - beam charge asymmetry
   * - ``ALU``
     - beam spin asymmetry
   * - ``ALUI``
     - beam spin asymmetry, interference part
   * - ``ALUDVCS``
     - beam spin asymmetry, DVCS part
   * - ``AUL``
     -  longitudinal target spin asymmetry
   * - ``AUT``
     -  transversal target spin asymmetry
   * - ``AUTI``
     - transversal target spin asymmetry, interference part
   * - ``AUTDVCS``
     - transversal target spin asymmetry, DVCS part
   * - ``BTSA``
     - beam (longitudinal) target double spin asymmetry
   * - ``ALTI``
     - beam transversal target double spin asymmetry, interference part
   * - ``ALTBHDVCS``
     - beam transversal target double spin asymmetry, BH-DVCS part

Many of these observables can be evaluated both as differential in azimuthal
angle :math:`\phi` (if the ``DataPoint`` argument has an attribute ``phi``),
or as "harmonic", i. e., as Fourier integral over :math:`\phi` (if the
``DataPoint`` argument has attribute ``FTn``).
Similary, ``XGAMMA`` will be evaluated as differential in :math:`t` if
``DataPoint`` has attribute ``t``, and as integrated over :math:`t` if
it doesn't.

.. list-table:: DVMP observables
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
   * - ``XGAMMA``
     - cross-section for production of meson by virtual photon

Choice whether DVCS or DVMP ``XGAMMA`` will be evaluated is dependent
on the value of ``pt.process``.
