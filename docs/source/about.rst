Gepard is software for analysis of three-dimensional distribution of quarks and gluons in hadrons,
encoded in terms of so-called Generalized Parton Distributions (GPD).

The software itself is available for download at GitHub (well, not yet, it will be
after some refactoring and after documentation is written)
