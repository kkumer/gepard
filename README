gepard - Package for evolving conformal moments of GEneral PARton 
         Distributions and calculation of DVCS form factors and observables

- Version 0.9.5

------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Note that there is additional documentation in gepard manual
doc/tex/gepard.pdf, and Fortran/C routines are extensively
self-documented in doc/html/masterindex.html .
That documentation includes description of more recent Mathematica 
interface, not included in this README.

========================================
1. Basic usage
========================================

(Assummes that you have downloaded package gepard-*.tgz with
all executables from somewhere.)

1.1 Calculating with Fortran executables
----------------------------------------

- First go to directory Tests/ and try to run executable './test' from 
  there, and see if numbers come out right. (By the way, one always needs to 
  have relevant input files, such as GEPARD.INI, in the working directory.)
  Try increasing SPEED in GEPARD.INI and see how numbers get worse.

- For additional tests, see Tests/README

1.2 Fitting using Minuit
------------------------

- Use provided executable 'fits/fit'.
  It needs to be started from directory fits/ where input files are.
  If you don't have Cygwin and PGPLOT, use 'fits/fit_nopgplot' instead!

- Parameters (not for fit ansatz but for everything else) are specified in
  GEPARD.INI which is self-documented.

- To select which experimental data will be used for fit, see file fit.dat
  Only sets between strings 'START' and 'STOP' will be used.
  (For exact meaning of lines in fit.dat see manual doc/tex/gepard.pdf)

- Commands for driving Minuit and for specifying initial values of
  fitting parameters are in file fit.cmd (see Minuit manual for their exact
  meaning!).


The list of output files and the more detailed description can be 
found in doc/tex/gepard.pdf


1.3 Producing example plots used in hep-ph/0703179
--------------------------------------------------

There are many example programs in directory ex/, which produce
numbers which are ploted in Figures of the big paper hep-ph/0703179. 
These numbers are in files with names of the form *[0-3].dat, where 
numbers [0-3] correspond to four panels that these figures usually have.

To automatically plot these data using grace plotting software see ex/README.
This ex/README also describes which executable produces which data.


====================================================================
2. Compilation and installation
====================================================================

You need information in this section only if you want to recreate executables
and documentation (ideally, they should be provided in distributed gepard-*.tgz
package). 
Also, if you want automatic plotting of fits (required by 'fit'
executable, but not by 'fit_nopgplot') you need to install PGPLOT library.
Otherwise, plots will still be generated, but without any symbols on them.


2.1 Unix requirements
---------------------
-  All executables ('test', 'radcorr', ... and all those in 'ex' subdirectory which
   produce some example data and plots), apart from 'fit' can be compiled using 
   just GNU gcc/g77/f77 compiler

- 'fit' program additionally needs CERNLIB's Minuit routine, usually contained
  in libraries 'kernlib' and 'packlib', distributed by CERN at
      http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/
  See section 2.4 for more details about installing Minuit.
  Location of these libraries should be specified as an environment variable
  CERNLIBS in Makefile.

  On Debian: apt-get install libkernlib1-dev libpacklib1-dev

- For plotting feature, 'fit' program also needs PGPLOT graphic library.
      http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/
  Location of this library should be specified as an environment variable
  PGPLOTLIBS in Makefile.
  See section 2.5 for more details about installing PGPLOT.
  If PGPLOT is not available, there is an alternative program fit_nopgplot
  that produces only tabular output.

  On Debian: apt-get install pgplot

- For recreating documentation, robodoc and LaTeX softwares are needed.
  Robodoc homepage is  http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html

  On Debian: apt-get install robodoc

- For plotting examples in ex/ and test/ (i.e. not for fit results),
  one already has prepared batch description files for 'grace' software.
  Grace's homepage: http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/
  (But results of examples are simple data file which can presumably be
   plotted by any plotting software.)

  On Debian: apt-get install grace

Precompiled Minuit and PGPLOT libraries for Linux can be obtained from
me, but if one wants to compile them himself, there are some instructions in 
Sections  2.4 and 2.5  below.

2.2 Microsoft Windows requirements
----------------------------------

Requirements are same as for Unix. I tested this only under cygwin
environment. Cygwin is easy to install: http://www.cygwin.com/
After installing basic setup.exe, and choosing some cygwin packages
server, one needs to choose packages which he wants installed
(by clicking on a small "Skip" icons shown by setup.exe; this wasn't
intuitive for me).
I guess that packages Devel/gcc-core, Devel/gcc-g77 and
Devel/make should be minimally enough but note that a lot of useful 
Unix utilities, editors etc. are available including the whole
of X Window System.
For documentation: robodoc and tetex packages are probably needed
For getting latest sources: subversion package


Precompiled Minuit and PGPLOT libraries for Windows can be obtained from
me, but if one wants to compile them himself, there are some instructions in 
Sections  2.4 and 2.5  below.


2.3 (Some) compilation targets
------------------------------

Following make commands should be issued in top gepard/ directory, where
main Makefile is located:

make test  - creates simple executable for testing
make auxtest  - creates simple executable for testing (this tests values
             of \mathcal{H} in two points corresponding to points "A" and "B"
             in notebook lett-num.nb)
make fit_nopgplot - creates executable for fitting, but without plotting 
make fit   - creates executable for fitting. It needs to be started
             from directory fits/ where input files are.
make radcorr - executable for Fig 1 of Letter  (only two points per plot
            by default. Change NPOINTS in radcorr.f for more)
make scaledep - executable for Fig 2 of Letter (also only two points.)
make hmtl  - creates HTML documentation (needs robodoc software)
make pdf   - creates LaTeX documentation (needs robodoc software)
make <example> (where <example> is one of the targets specified
          in file ex/README) - creates example executables in directory 'ex'.
          These than produce numbers for plots shown in big paper hep-ph/0703179.
make all   - makes everything above and maybe more
make clean - removes all objects which are easily recreatable


2.4 Installation of Minuit library
----------------------------------

2.4.1 Linux

For some Linux distributions precompiled binaries are available at
http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/. For Debian, there are packages
libpacklib1-dev libkernlib1-dev available in the usual repositories.

2.4.2. Microsoft Windows

One can compile just a Minuit part of packlib from sources available at
http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/download/2001_wnt/src/packlib/minuit/code/
Then one additionally needs just INTRAC routine from kernlib. As explained
in Minuit manual, this can be just a simple routine like

      LOGICAL FUNCTION INTRAC ()
      INTRAC = .FALSE.
      RETURN
      END


2.5 Installation of PGPLOT library
----------------------------------

2.5.1 Linux

It's straightforward. Just follow the instructions at
http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/install-unix.html

Dont forget to define shell environment variables, e.g. for
bash/zsh/sh :

export PGPLOT_DIR="${HOME}/local/lib/pgplot/"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$HOME/local/lib/pgplot"


2.5.2. Microsoft Windows

As with the whole of gepard, only usage inside cygwin environment
is supported. I have successfully compiled PGPLOT with Postscript driver 
/PSDRIV, but not with /XSERVE driver.
For this, I used configuration file shown on top of the WWW page
http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/install-gnuwin.html
This I put into file sys_cygwin/g77_gcc.conf (instead of what's there
by default), and then I followed Unix installation instructions on
http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/install-unix.html.

You may have to define environment variables as in Linux case.
