Python prototype for GPDfit software
------------------------------------

Usage:  
------
Start ipython shell and do '%run pype'
(if you don't have ipython you can do 'python -i pype.py')
Then proceed with interactive work e.g. 'plotHERMES(data, b, fitpars)'

Files
------
ansatz.py - definition of CFFs
Approach.py - classes for theoretical approaches to calculation of observables
constants.py - constants
data/  -  directory with data files
Data.py -  classes for representation of data
plots.py  - auxiliary functions for plotting results
publish.py - script that publishes datafiles to www dir
pype.py  - main script which does the fitting
quadrature.py  - Gaussian quadrature routines
README
utils.py  - datafile parsing, dataset plotting and other auxilliary routines
www - directory with HTML representation of data
