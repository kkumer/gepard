## Synopsis

**Gepard** - package for modelling and fitting generalized parton distributions (GPDs)

Modelling GPDs in conformal moment space, perturbative QCD evolutiona and calculation of conformal Compton form factors (CFFs) up to NNLO accuracy. Modelling CFFs using dispersion relations. Calculation of DVCS and DVMP observables. Fitting to experimental data.


## Installation

First make the pygepard extension library.
**Prerequisites**: C and Fortran compilers. 
```sh
make pygepards
```
Then go into pype directory, `make optModel.so`, start (i)python and
run `pype.py` which has the initalization stuff.

## License

GPL, once gepard becomes public.
