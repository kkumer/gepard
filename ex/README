Producing Figures for KMPK06b:
-----------------------------

Step 1: 

In base directory (so cd .. from here):

make <target>

where possible targets are: 

radNLO   - singlet radiative corr., NLO in both schemes
radQ     - singlet radiative corr., Q^2 dependence
radNNLO. - singlet radiative corr., NNLO


Step 2:

Execute program <target>. This produces data
files <target>[0,1,...].dat


Step 3.

Look at plots of data (must have grace installed) by

plt <target>

To have nicer view in grace window, comment out the second line
in <target>.bat (page size 500 350).

Alternatively, have <target>.eps created (must have fragmaster installed) by

plt -b <target>

To fine-tune bounding box of resulting EPS files, change it like this:
%%BoundingBox: 0 * * 8??   ->  5 * * 795
