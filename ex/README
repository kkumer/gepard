Producing Figures for hep-ph/0703179:
------------------------------------

Step 1: 

In base directory (so cd .. from here):

make <target>

where possible targets are: 

auxsi(auxns) -  auxilliary programs calculating single point 
scales(NS)  -  produce Tables 1 and 2 
scalesNNLO  -  produces Table 3
radNLO(NS)  -  radiative corr., NLO in both schemes (Figs 7 and 9)
evolut(NS)  -  NLO evolution from one scale to another (Figs 8 and 10)
radQ        -  dependance on Q^2 (Fig. 11)
radNNLO(NS) -  NNLO evolution from one scale to another (Figs 12 and 13)
anatomy(NS) -  anatomy of various NLO contributions


Step 2:

Execute program <target> in this directory. This produces data
files <target>[0,1,...].dat


Step 3.

Look at plots of data (must have grace installed) by

plt <target>

To have nicer view in grace window, comment out the second line
in <target>.bat (page size 500 350).

Alternatively, have <target>.eps created (must have fragmaster installed) by

plt -b <target>




Steps 2 and 3 can be done automatically by 

make <target>.eps     ("make all" and "make everything" (long) do all figs)
