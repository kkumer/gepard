Physics: 
-  t_cut of ZEUS data is infinity? DVCS[46].DAT

Computing:
-  Go to www.hepforge.org?
-  Make fancy C-MathLink communication function that recognizes input type
-  Remove unused variables (specially in adacf, or specially not there)?
-  In fitting parameters should be non-squared quantities
-  use autoconf and friends
-  MSBND -> MSBAR, MSBAR -> MSBDI
-  Automatize putting Alekhin's PDFs into fitpdfs
-  We don't need both HGRID and MBGPD, it seems. (Or HGRID memorises
   PDFs during fitting, so it's needed?)
-  deriv.f should be copyright-cleared
-  PAR(18) and (28) hardwired in CompileMoments[]
-  Using GOTO statements in fcn.F should be avoided
-  Charge factor treatment should be improved
-  filenames setting should be separated from GepardInitInternal because
   this is not needed for cffEinternal and cffHinternal
-  Numbers in fit.c should be changed by preprocesor variables
-  Implementing Talbot contour for MB integration (cf. e.g. hep-ph/0607122)


Checks:
-  Check F_2 of DIS beyond LO (compare to Vogt etc.). Why is BIGCF2 \neq CDIS2
-  Check plotting of error-bars (Implement stat-syst as in 
   original papers and Dieter's femtoholographic paper?)
   It seems that grace is doing this wrong for log-y axis!

Design:
-  Verbatim \ref in robodoc TeX?

DONE:
+  Transfer adacf Fortran routines to gepard to make it independent
   of adacf library.  (Done in ver. 0.89)
+  Check NLO DIS evolution against Les Houches table 3 or 4 (done in ver. 0.9.2)
+  Include MS-bar evolution
+  improve behaviour for large \xi so that comparison to
   NLO Les Houches is everywhere ok
+  Put evolution operators on common block when Q0 is fixed
+  Move all gaussian points to gauss.f  (from dvcs.f e.g.)
+  Check NNLO DIS evolution against Les Houches table 3 or 4
+  Restore MathLink communication
+  FIT->FITBP  FITOLD->TEST
+  Beautify Robodoc output.
+  There should be no dots on red fit lines
+  Improve /XSERVE output.
+  Implement plotting of GPD slopes
+  There should be PDF() function so that PDFs are not calculated
   internally in FCN()
+  tmp.mma is a kludge
+  FIT.INI should have optional name, changable by mma interface
+  PrintMinuitCommand should inquire FILENAMES common block for filename
