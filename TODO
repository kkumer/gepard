Physics: 
-  t_cut of ZEUS data is infinity? DVCS[46].DAT

Computing:
-  Make fancy C-MathLink communication function that recognizes input type
-  Remove unused variables (specially in adacf, or specially not there)?
-  In fitting parameters should be non-squared quantities
-  FIT.INI file should not have hardcoded filename but it should be passed via command line
-  use autoconf and friends

Checks:
-  Check plotting of error-bars (Implement stat-syst as in 
   original papers and Dieter's femtoholographic paper?)
   It seems that grace is doing this wrong for log-y axis!

Design:
-  Verbatim \ref in robodoc TeX?
-  Beautify Robodoc output.
-  Improve /XSERVE output.

DONE:
+  Transfer adacf Fortran routines to gepard to make it independent
   of adacf library.  (Done in ver. 0.89)
+  Check NLO DIS evolution against Les Houches table 3 or 4 (done in ver. 0.9.2)
+  Include MS-bar evolution
+  improve behaviour for large \xi so that comparison to
   NLO Les Houches is everywhere ok
+  Put evolution operators on common block when Q0 is fixed
+  Move all gaussian points to gauss.f  (from dvcs.f e.g.)
+  Check NNLO DIS evolution against Les Houches table 3 or 4
+  Restore MathLink communication
