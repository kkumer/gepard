1 -  Code taken from Vogt/Vermasseren may not be pure double precision.
    (Although maybe it behaves as double precision.)

2 -  Complex tangent DCTAN may be problematic (Demidovich?)

3 -  Interactive mode might freeze on MS Windows


5!-  one must 'make clean' between making  gepard.exe and non-mma executables
     (and similarly with fit.exe with PGPLOT)
    (Thus, 'make all' probably doesn't work as intended.)

6 -  houches still problematic for very large x_BJ. At input scale as well!
     Related to that. Large x_BJ extension of integration should be automatic.
     (Note that evolution operator diverges for x_BJ->1 so one should treat
     this somehow, cf. Rojos PhD thesis.)

7!-  Coercion to COMPLEX is not working! Thus, one must treat by hand 
    or set fancy rules to anticipate real arguments while SPLICE-ing.

8 -  Checking for new /XSERVE window is done only when plotting fit lines

9 -  cffH without explicit P argument returns zero!

10 - incompatible with Mathematica 6 (probably fixed)

11 - .mnt file is not named according to OUTFILE

13! - Numerics is not perfectly stable. For PHI>>PI/2 resummed ansatz can
      create problems, and for PHI = PI/2 convergence is not so perfect.
      Results also depend on C more than they should.

14 - auxtest is broken

15 -  gepard-api.pdf is not generated

Fixed:
------

2008-06-10 - CFFs should be, like F2, defined with charge factors included 

2008-01-19 -  One has to delete .mnt file sometimes or PrintMinuitCommand is not ok.
   (Maybe one should use separate file and open/close it?)

2008-01-19 -  filename specification is iconsistent between fit.exe and gepard.exe
              (fit.exe without and gepard.exe with extensions)

2008-01-19 -  Stars denoting fixed parameters is buggy

2007-11-19 -  mma interface function cffH is not accurate [I didn't use proper
              GEPARD.INI before, it seems. Everything is fine.]

2007-07 -  SPEED=4 is unreliable [=3 preferable now]

2007-07 -  NNLO comparison to Vogt is bad [not same an. dims used]

2006-12-13 -  Because of ND evolution all MB integrations go 0..500
              now which is overkill for "outer" integration and makes
              everything unnecessary 30% slower

2006-12-09 -  Expansion of evol. operator is in \mu_r, and should be \mu_f

2006-11-17 -  PS figures drawn by fit.exe at Dieter's notebook, have no text, just lines
             (Path to PGPLOT libs had to be put in shell's environment.)
 
2006-09-22 - charge factors corrected (were missing from DVCS), 
             and are now OK for NF = 3 or 4

2006-08-02 - parameter P not used in the DIS part of fit.F 

2008-08-13 4!-  fitres is behaving funny for C=0.25 (merged to bug 13)
