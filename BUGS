 - Long gepard test are agreeing only wih 1-2 siginficant digits.
   This is not good enough.

 - after calling gpdF.... stuff everything is broken because
   g...process is changed and gepard must be completely reinitialized

 - some XDVCS points have pt.t attribute (This is now dangerous
   bug because X relies on pt.t. Is it still true?)

 - Kelly's neutron FFs differ from mma cca 1%

 - It is not clear whose duty is to call fill_kinematics(), 
    to_conventions() and prepare() !!

 - chisq() method of neural net theories takes too long to evaluate

 - outputvalue is both keyword arg for CFF, and parameter of NN model. Is
   this necessary?

 + fixing and releasing parameters should be methods of Fitter,
   and not Model?
