-  Code taken from Vogt/Vermasseren may not be pure double precision.
  (Although maybe it behaves as double precision.)

-  Complex tangent DCTAN may be problematic

-  Interactive mode freezes on MS Windows

-  Because of ND evolution all MB integrations go 0..500
   now which is overkill for "outer" integration and makes
   everything unnecessary 30% slower

-  SPEED=4 is unreliable


Fixed:
------

2006-08-02 - parameter P not used in the DIS part of fit.F 
 
2006-09-22 - charge factors corrected (were missing from DVCS), 
             and are now OK for NF = 3 or 4

2006-11-17 -  PS figures drawn by fit.exe at Dieter's notebook, have no text, just lines
             (Path to PGPLOT libs had to be put in shell's environment.)

2006-12-09 -  Expansion of evol. operator is in \mu_r, and should be \mu_f
