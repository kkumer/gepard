This directory holds available experimental data

ep2epgamma/ - relevant experimental data for e p --> e p gamma
gammastarp2gammap/ - data for \gamma^* p --> \gamma p  i.e. DVCS
gammastarp2Mp/ - data for \gamma^* p --> meson p  i.e. DVMP
DIS/  - data for DIS  
old/ - old data files

Note:
There should be unique correspondence between id number of datafile
(specified at its beginning), and the grid of numbers in that
file. Thus, 

1) If you do something to numbers, create new file and new ID !
2) If you just edit information in preamble, you may keep old ID,
   but if you have doubts, create new file with new ID - there 
   are plenty of integers available
3) Do not delete old datafiles - just move it to directory 'old',
   maybe with putting some comment into them

This makes it much easier to reproduce old results.

Some informal conventions:

- ids beyond ID=1000 are for mock/fake data 
- ids beyond ID=500 are for derived data (derived from
  actual data using some contestable theoretical procedure)
- ID=200+ are for DIS data
