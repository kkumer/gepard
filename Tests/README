Accuracy and dependence on SPEED (from GEPARD.INI) can be studied by
the following test programs.

Make sure to use AS0=0.05 in GEPARD.INI (this is how referent numbers
were obtained). 
Best agreement should be obtained by SPEED=1.

Also note that by default GEPARD.INI uses Mellin-Barnes contour strictly
perpendicular to real axis (PHI=PI/2). Much better accuracy is obtained
by slanting this contour (e.g. PHI=1.9). However, then some numerical
problems may surface (especially when using full non-diagonal MS-bar evolution)
and results should be checked (although they will be fine 99% of times
and this is why PHI=1.9 is default for fitting).

First test
----------
For testing the DVCS and DIS observables for some test values of
parameters, use executable './test'.

Second test 
-----------
Testing the intermediate values of CFFs can be done using
executable './auxtest'. (Note that this is useful mostly for
debugging, if the first test comes out right, this one is
certain to come out right as well.) 


Third test
----------
lett/FIG2A-LETT.dat (FIG1A-LETT.dat) is part of data from Fig. 2 (1) from the letter
hep-ph/0605237.  After running scaledep (radcorr) program, consistency should
be checked by

diff lett/FIG2A-LETT.dat FIG2A.dat

(diff lett/FIG1A-LETT.dat FIG1A.dat)

Or, better, diff -> vimdiff


Fourth test (broken presently)
-----------
run executable ./houches and resulting files show relative difference with
respect to evolution of Les Houches benchmark gluon PDF, as evaluated
by QCD-Pegasus package. Plot it by
xmgrace NLOACC.dat -batch acc.bat
xmgrace NNLOACC.dat -batch acc.bat


Fifth test
-----------
run executable ./accuracy and resulting file shows relative difference with
respect to the most precise gepard DVCS result available (SPEED=1, ACC=6).
Good for testing influence of SPEED parameter. Plot it by
xmgrace acc.dat -batch acc.bat
