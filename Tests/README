Accuracy and dependance on SPEED (from GEPARD.INI) can be studied by
the following test programs.

Make sure to use AS0=0.05 in GEPARD.INI. Best agreement should be
obtained by SPEED=1.

First test
----------
For testing the DVCS and DIS observables for some test values of
parameters, use executable 'test'.

Second test
-----------
Testing the intermediate values of CFFs can be done using
executable 'auxtest'. (Note that this is useful mostly for
debugging, if the first test comes out right, this one is
certain to come out right as well.)


Third test
----------
lett/FIG2A-LETT.DAT (FIG1A-LETT.DAT) is part of data from Fig. 2 (1) from the letter
hep-ph/0605237.  After running scaledep (radcorr) program, consistency should
be checked by

diff lett/FIG2A-LETT.DAT FIG2A.DAT

(diff lett/FIG1A-LETT.DAT FIG1A.DAT)

Or, better, diff -> vimdiff

The role of Mathematica part (in directory mma/) is explained in main README.
